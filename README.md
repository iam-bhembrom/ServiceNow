# 🛠️ ServiceNow Developer Toolkit: Custom Scripts & Utilities

Welcome to my personal repository of **ServiceNow** scripts and architectural patterns. As a developer within the ecosystem, I’ve found that we often encounter the same hurdles—whether it’s complex data transformations, sleek UI requirements, or automating the mundane. This repository is a curated collection of the solutions I’ve built to tackle these challenges.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?
This repo is organized by functional area to help you find exactly what you need:

* **Server-Side Logic:** Optimized Business Rules, Script Includes, and complex GlideRecord queries designed for performance.
* **Client-Side Enhancements:** Catalog Client Scripts and UI Policies that prioritize user experience without sacrificing browser speed.
* **Integration Hub & APIs:** Boilerplate scripts for REST/SOAP integrations and scripted REST APIs.
* **Flow Designer & Workflows:** Custom Flow actions and legacy workflow scripts for end-to-end automation.
* **Background Scripts & Fixes:** A "Swiss Army Knife" of snippets for one-time data corrections and administrative cleanup.

## 💡 Why Use These?
Every script here is born from real-world requirements. I focus on **reusability**, **readability**, and **best practices** (e.g., avoiding global objects where possible and ensuring scripts are "Update Set friendly").

## ⚠️ Disclaimer & Usage
While these scripts are developed and tested in personal developer instances (PDIs) or controlled environments, please remember:

1.  **Test in Sub-Prod:** Never move code directly to Production without thorough testing.
2.  **Adapt to Your Instance:** Ensure field names and `sys_ids` are updated to match your specific configuration.
